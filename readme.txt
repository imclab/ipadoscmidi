version 1.0

This program is a simulator to test Midi and Osc communication in iOS. There is a companion Max/MSP patch in the archive (oscmiditest3.maxpat). The Max patch lets you control the user interface on the iPad. And it displays incoming messages from the iPad.

I have only tested the default iOS midi networking devices via Mac OS, and an iRig Midi interface. 

This is the only documentation right now - but there are big plans, yeah, for a programming guide, and a free app store app, along the lines of audioGraph.

I wanted to get this initial version out before a spacecraft lands in the backyard.
